Just to clear up: (just in case it's necessary) 
 I'm a girl but some of my OC's are male (: 

I may embody the OC I'm using, but other times I'm just using them to look at and chill, lol.. 

But yeah, that's all, didn't wanna end up confusing anybody or make it weird somehow lol.    ANYWAYS!
- Also I don't ERP ! So no matter your gender or the gender of the OC I'm using.. don't try anything, thanks. (:
- Though, if you want to RP, that's okay, just ask first or use context clues and depending on how I feel is what the outcome will be.
'KAY BYEE FOR NOW!
